Problem 15 Lattice Paths

You can only go right and down. So in a 2x2 grid to reach bottom you need to go down twice and right twice every single time. Can use binomial formula nCr (4C2) to get 6. 
This is because it will tell you how many different possible combinations it is possible to go either right twice or down twice which would give every single path. As 4 total
movements and 2 of them will be right or down.

This means can use same logic but instead on a much larger scale of 20x20. This would be (40C20) 137,846,528,820.
